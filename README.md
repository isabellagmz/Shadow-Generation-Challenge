# Shadow Generation Challenge

This project is an implementation of the Shadow Generation for Composite Image in Real-World Scenes paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10338.pdf) 

I will be using the DESOBA dataset which was created for this project by the authors.

The approach to this project is divided in two parts, the Shadow Mask Generation stage and the Shadow Area Filling stage. 

In this repository are the Jupyter Notebooks that were created for each of these sections, as well as a document explaining the methodology and the results obtained.
